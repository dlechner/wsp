			<h1>WSP 1.9 Project Analysis</h1>
			<h2>Site Intent</h2>
				<p>The <a href="http://www.getgamingorlando.com">Get Gaming</a>website is is for a business that repairs broken game consoles in   the Orlando area.  Based off what I have learned in this program for good practices in web standards, this site fails to meet them on many levels.  My intent for this site redesign would be to clean up the fonts, and make a more noticeable and interactive nav bar for starters. If your web page is difficult to read and navigate, your site will have a low conversion rate and could actually lose you business.  The backgrounds also detract from the typography as it bleeds into the text since they are the same color.  Cleaning up the headers to distinguish themselves from the rest of the content will also support visual hierarchy and make it easier for users to scan the information quickly. Numerous overflow errors are on multiple pages and need to be recoded and hidden correctly.  I also feel the client should rethink their business name, "Get Gaming" does not immediately inform the user that their business is solely based on video game console repair.  To me it seems like a place to go buy video games yet they do not sell games at all.  Some of these errors in coding look very sloppy and could convey a message the business doesn't want, "Unprofessional, sloppy website means unprofessional, sloppy service to the customer".  That is definitely not the message they want out there!</p>
			<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
				<p>Their competition as far as web presence goes is pretty tough.  Using <a href="http://www.alexa.com">www.alexa.com</a> showed that they did a decent job with the keywords for SEO but there is some redundancy in their keywords that do not show good semantics.  Their website compared directly to their competition in their local area showed they did not put much thought into their web design, nor did they compare their design to their immediate competition to see how they could "1 up them".  For example <a href="http://www.aeontech360.com">Aeontech360.com</a> is a very clean cut, reduced website with a seriously nice animated CTA element that I would love to learn how to do.  Their design tells me as a potential customer that they take their web presence seriously so they probably take their customers and services seriously.  Comparing their website to the <a href="http://www.getgamingorlando.com">Get Gaming</a>, I would definitely use Aeontech360 just based on the fact of their professional looking website.</p>
			<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
				<p>According to the Entertainment Software Association's <a href="http://www.theesa.com/facts/gameplayer.asp">Game Player Data Facts</a> shows that video game consoles have a diverse audience.  The average gamer is around 37yrs old with 82% of gamers being 18 years of age or older.  According to their data 72% of American households play computer and video games.  That means the potential for customers to their website is huge!  But I wouldn't expect an 8 year old Wii gamer to be going on the internet looking for a gaming console repair shop.  Children/young gamers would be having their parents looking into it for them.  But the 18yr old or the 40 yr old gamer with a broken system and basic internet skills would be searching the web for a repair shop easily.  Having said that and to summarize my research, targeted audiences would be:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Parents/guardians of young gamers.</li>
					<li>Teenage to adult gamers.</li>
					<li>Casual to hardcore gamers.</li>
				</ul>
